- 👋 Hi, I’m @BrandonJenkins09
- 👀 I’m interested in R coding, data mining, machine learning, Keras, Tensorflow.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R coding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone that would like to trade your knowledge and some patience for the 
-     use of my computer.  I own a nice piece of hardware, a 3rd gen 24 core Threadripper w/ 128GB 4000mhz Ram
-     connected to 3x1TB 4th Gen HD's @ 6200MB/s transfer a RTX 3090 and have a gigabit connection up/down.
-     I'm getting acquainted with Keras and Tensorflow by using the RTX3090 to run tensor assisted ML models
-     and this thing handles it as well as it does rendering that I bought it for and can't seem to find work
-     with.  It's exciting to watch, strangely.  As amazing as it could ever be though, I need someone to
-     need my computer to do real work so that I can have a reason to push harder into the field.  Let's
-     call it an unpaid internship, or a paid internship even if you feel like you'd be able to use me
-     enough despite my limited background.   
- 📫 How to reach me, BrandonJenkins09@gmail.com, Please note in the header that you've found this through Git so I don't pass over your msg.  Tyvm.
